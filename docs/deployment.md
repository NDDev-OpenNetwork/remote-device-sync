# Deployment — rds-server / rds-agent

Reference deployment: `rds-server` (relay + discovery directory) and
`rds-agent` on a Linux host under systemd. Units live in
`deploy/systemd/`; copy them to `/etc/systemd/system/`.

## Install

```sh
# binaries (release build)
cargo build --release -p rds-server -p rds-agent -p rds-cli
install -m0755 target/release/rds-server /usr/local/bin/
install -m0755 target/release/rds-agent  /usr/local/bin/
install -m0755 target/release/rds        /usr/local/bin/

# users + state

systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now rds-server rds-agent
```

The agent creates `endpoint.key` on first start (`0600`, enforced by
`load_or_create_key`). The endpoint id it publishes is derived from
that key — keep it across reinstalls or the device's identity changes.
`rds id` prints the bare hex id needed for `--allow` lists.

**One runtime owner per key.** Ordinary CLI connectivity uses the same-UID
local agent's endpoint through its private manager socket; it does not load a
second copy of that identity. The default directory is `<agent-key-file>.control`.
Use `--control-dir` for a custom location. A system service under another UID
is not an operator-user broker: run the operator's own user agent. Do not loosen
socket permissions to bridge that boundary.

Explicit `rds --direct --key-file ~/.config/remote-device-sync/cli.key …` retains
independent operation for diagnostics and the unfinished desktop/sync manager
APIs. Give it a separate authorized key. Updated agent, direct CLI and owned
relay binaries refuse a seed inode already in use before binding. Upgrade all
local binaries together; old binaries and copied/manual-replaced keys are outside
this cooperative guarantee. See [migration and ownership](local-sessions.md).
The relay's `--allow` covers every endpoint that may use the relay.

## Ports and firewall

| Port | Proto | Service | Exposure |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 3340 | tcp | relay (iroh relay protocol over HTTP) | public — endpoints behind NAT dial in |
| 3341 | tcp | discovery HTTP(S) API (`PUT/GET/DELETE /v1/records`, `/v1/registry`, `/v1/revocations`, `/v1/health`) | estate members; configure directory TLS for lookup confidentiality; writes are signature-verified |
| operator-selected | tcp | separate authenticated `GET /metrics` | disabled by default; explicit loopback bind and private bearer token; local collector only |
| — | udp | endpoint QUIC data path + hole-punching | endpoints need outbound UDP; inbound UDP only required to *receive* direct paths (relay fallback covers its absence) |

Minimal nftables for the services host:

```nft
table inet rds {
    chain input {
        type filter hook input priority 0; policy drop;
        ct state established,related accept
        iif lo accept
        tcp dport { 22, 3340, 3341 } accept
    }
}
```

`rds-agent` needs no inbound allow rule: it dials the relay outbound and
accepts direct paths opportunistically (hole-punched or via the
endpoint's discovered addresses).

**Relay redundancy.** `--relay` is repeatable on both `rds` and
`rds-agent`; iroh probes all configured relays, homes on the
lowest-latency one, and fails over automatically. Production should run
≥2 `rds-relay`/`rds-server` instances in different failure domains and
list all their URLs — no LB or failover plumbing is needed on the relay
side, since every endpoint carries the full list.

**TLS on the relay.** `rds-server` serves the iroh relay protocol
(WebSocket over HTTP) on 3340 in plaintext: relayed payloads are
end-to-end-encrypted QUIC the relay cannot read, and relay admission is
keyed by `EndpointId` signature challenge, so a network MITM can only
disrupt, not decrypt. For defence-in-depth on a public IP the relay
supports native TLS in two modes:

```bash
# manual PEM (certbot, internal CA, any provider)
rds-server --tls-cert /etc/rds/cert.pem --tls-key /etc/rds/key.pem

# or in-process Let's Encrypt (TLS-ALPN-01 — requires port 443
# reachable from the internet, so a privileged bind or a redirect)
rds-server --tls-acme-domain relay.example.com \
           --tls-acme-contact mailto:ops@example.com \
           --tls-acme-cache /var/lib/rds/acme
```

HTTPS binds `--tls-https-addr` (default `0.0.0.0:3443`; the
unprivileged unit cannot bind 443 — for 443 add
`AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` to the unit). The plaintext
HTTP port keeps serving only the captive-portal probe. Endpoints then
dial `--relay https://<host>:<port>`; the relay protocol rides WebSocket
inside TLS unchanged. A TCP-level TLS terminator (nginx `stream`,
haproxy) in front of 3340 remains a valid alternative.

The relay serves `GET /healthz` → `200` on its HTTP(S) listener for
load-balancer and monitoring probes.

**Tunnel/VPN integration is optional.** RDS does not invoke tunnel or VPN
helper processes. Direct connections use UDP; the relay and directory have
separately configured TCP listeners. Cloudflare Tunnel/WARP may be evaluated
as estate deployment options under W3, using measured setup latency, ongoing
SSH/desktop/sync traffic, idle timeout, reconnect and outage behavior. The
native directory HTTPS tests below do not qualify a Cloudflare route or any
other edge proxy. Keep endpoint identity and policy independent of whichever
route is selected, and retain a separately tested recovery path.

### Native directory HTTPS

The directory supports its own TLS listener inside `rds-server`, with no
proxy/helper process required. It is separate from relay TLS: supplying
`--tls-cert` alone does not encrypt the directory. Example configuration
(synthetic hostname and paths):

```sh
rds-server --http-addr 0.0.0.0:3341 \
  --directory-allow <base32-device-key> \
  --directory-tls-cert /etc/rds/directory-chain.pem \
  --directory-tls-key /etc/rds/directory-key.pem
rds-agent --directory https://directory.example.com:3341 \
  --registry-key <base32-verifying-key> <agent-policy-flags>
rds ping device-a
```

The certificate must cover the configured hostname (or IP SAN for an IP URL).
Clients use public WebPKI roots by default. For a private CA, supply
`--directory-ca /etc/rds/directory-ca.pem` to `rds` and `rds-agent`; the bundle
**replaces** public roots. Empty/invalid bundles and a CA flag on an HTTP
endpoint are errors. There is no skip-verification option, redirect following
or HTTP fallback. The registry verifying key remains separately provisioned;
a TLS certificate cannot authorize a name binding.

Directory membership is separately provisioned with repeated
`--directory-allow <base32-device-key>` arguments (maximum 4096 distinct,
nonweak Ed25519 keys). An empty list denies record PUT, GET and DELETE, while
health and configured policy routes remain available. This is independent of
relay `--allow` and agent peer permissions. Removing a key and restarting denies
its record access while preserving its replay floor; it does not revoke an
already running endpoint session. Use grant revocation for that. Name registry
updates cannot silently enroll publishers. GDS reconciliation/hot membership
updates remain W4. The shipped systemd template is closed until customized.

Each known device has one protected new mutation in a fixed 60-second accounting
window, independent of shared extra-write and new-admission budgets. Use TTL
at least 180 seconds for the TTL/3 announcer to fit that reserved cadence (the
default 300 does). Faster renewals and additional route changes need the shared
burst budget. This is admission fairness, not a measured throughput or arbitrary
network-flooding guarantee; see [record-state.md](record-state.md).

Client origins accept `https://host[:port]`, explicit `http://host[:port]`,
or legacy `IP:port` (plaintext). Paths, credentials, queries and fragments are
refused. DNS is resolved on each request with a bounded, staggered dial race;
all work shares a default 3-second deadline. The directory uses HTTP/1.1 with
Content-Length framing and closes after each exchange. Duplicate lengths,
Transfer-Encoding, compressed bodies, interim responses and Expect are refused;
queries and upgrades are outside this private API. Configure any intermediary
to preserve the [directory HTTP profile](record-state.md#directory-http-profile).
Compatibility with particular edge proxies/tunnels has not been qualified by
these loopback TLS tests.

When directory TLS is enabled, `--http-addr` accepts only TLS. Health probes
must also use HTTPS with normal certificate validation. The listener uses
the same connection cap and a 10-second absolute deadline including TLS.
Provision a renewed certificate and restart the server to load it; directory
hot reload/ACME is not implemented. Keep the PEM key readable only by the
service identity. The public directory listener has no metrics route, including
requests through a loopback reverse proxy. Keep the separate authenticated
admin listener local; do not forward it through a proxy or tunnel.

Agent startup does not wait for an external relay: after endpoint bind, local
service and admin supervision start even if the relay is disabled/unreachable.
Directory announcement follows address changes. The printed startup ticket is a
point-in-time snapshot and can precede relay availability; listener readiness
alone is not an end-to-end reachability check.

## Sandboxing

Both units set `NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`,
`ProtectHome`, `PrivateTmp`, `PrivateDevices`, `ProtectKernel*`,
`ProtectControlGroups`, `RestrictSUIDSGID`, `LockPersonality`,
`RestrictRealtime`, `CapabilityBoundingSet=` (empty),
`RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_INET AF_INET6 AF_UNIX`,
`SystemCallFilter=@system-service`. `rds-server` additionally sets
`MemoryDenyWriteExecute`. Writable paths are limited to the unit's
`StateDirectory` via `ReadWritePaths`.

Caveats:

- **Agent desktop service**: X11 capture and input injection need a
  session display and `/dev/uinput` — run the agent as a user service
  in the graphical session for desktop, or relax `PrivateDevices` and
  add `DeviceAllow=/dev/uinput rw` plus `SupplementaryGroups=input`.
  `PrivateTmp` also hides `/tmp/.X11-unix` from the unit — the session
  X socket won't be reachable unless the display listens on the
  abstract socket (default on Linux) or `PrivateTmp` is dropped.
- **Agent `--sync-dir`**: add its path to `ReadWritePaths` or keep it
  under `/var/lib/rds-agent`.
- **Key material**: `endpoint.key` must stay `0600` and owned by the
  service user (`stat -c '%a %U' /var/lib/rds-agent/endpoint.key`
  → `600 rds-agent`). The estate signing key never lives on this host —
  `--registry-key`/`--revocations-key` are verifying (public) keys.

## Runbook

### Signed name lookup migration

The name API returns a per-name signature proof. Upgrade the registry issuer,
directory and name-using clients together: re-create snapshots with the updated
`SignedRegistry::sign` or `publish` so they contain `bindings`, and distribute
the registry **public** key independently through GDS/configuration. The issuer
private key stays with the estate. Names use lowercase ASCII letters, digits
and hyphens (1–63 bytes); snapshots have at most 256 names and must fit the
256 KiB HTTP body limit. Each binding is valid for at most 24 hours; issuer and
clients need synchronized clocks (`issued_at <= now < expires_at`).

```sh
rds-agent --directory 127.0.0.1:3341 --registry-key <base32-verifying-key>
rds ping device-a
```

New clients refuse missing anchors and unsigned legacy responses. Existing
tickets and pinned endpoint-key lookups retain their independent trust path.
The directory refuses expired names even if no newer snapshot has arrived.
The CLI uses a durable 1024-name freshness cache and a global registry revision;
it refuses capacity overflow instead of evicting anti-rollback history.
Snapshots now require positive authority epoch/revision metadata, registry/name
signature domain v2, and revocation domain v1. The issuer must persist revision
allocation and publish renewals. See [durable policy migration](policy-state.md)
for state paths, dual-signed authority rotation and reboot behavior. Managed
`--issuer` mode also requires `--directory` and `--revocations-key`. A missing or
stale revocation lease closes admission and live connections; a fetch failure
cannot replace the denylist or extend its lifetime. HTTPS protects the lookup exchange;
signatures preserve identity verification independently of that transport.

### Restart

```sh
systemctl restart rds-server        # ~1s outage; clients reconnect via backoff
journalctl -u rds-server -f         # watch "relay listening" / "directory listening"
curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:3341/v1/health   # {"ok":true}
```

### Upgrade

```sh
install -m0755 target/release/rds-server /usr/local/bin/rds-server.new
mv /usr/local/bin/rds-server.new /usr/local/bin/rds-server
systemctl restart rds-server
journalctl -u rds-server --since -1m     # confirm clean start
```

Records in `/var/lib/rds/directory` persist; clients re-announce within
their TTL window (default 300 s), so a restarted directory refills
itself. To roll back, reinstall the previous binary and restart.

### Drain / decommission

```sh
systemctl stop rds-server    # relay closes; endpoints fall back to
                             # direct paths or the next configured relay
```

There is no in-service drain flag yet: stopping the relay drops
relayed connections, which retry through their remaining relays or
migrate to direct paths. Announce the drain in advance for attended
sessions.

### Failure modes

The W1.5 record-store format is changing. Legacy per-key JSON directories now
refuse startup instead of discarding replay history. Deployment migration is
pending the explicit format-3 migration procedure; see [record-state.md](record-state.md).
Preserve the complete directory, and never remove an anchor to force startup.
The experimental format-1/format-2 databases are also refused. After a server
OS reboot, stored endpoint leases require newer publisher revisions; active
publishers recover on their next announce, normally within TTL/3. A 410 response
then requests one locally allocated successor. Collection preserves identity
history, so a full identity budget requires authenticated lifecycle maintenance,
not deletion of database files. Watch `rds_directory_gc_failures_total` for
clock/storage refusal and preserve evidence before repair.

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rds ssh`/`ping` never connects | relay unreachable | `curl http://<host>:3340/` ; `ss -tlnp \| grep 3340` | open tcp/3340, restart unit |
| connects but only via relay, no direct upgrade | UDP blocked both ways | metrics: `paths_seen{via="direct"}` stays 0 | allow outbound UDP; check NAT hairpin |
| `GET /v1/records/<id>` 404 after restart | records expired pre-restart | directory files under `/var/lib/rds/directory` | clients re-announce within TTL; lower `--record-ttl` |
| `PUT /v1/registry` refused | missing/wrong `--registry-key` | unit `ExecStart` args | install the estate verifying key |
| service refuses grant-mode streams | denylist stale or clock skew | `journalctl -u rds-agent`, `timedatectl` | fix clock; confirm `--revocations-key` matches estate |
| `/v1/metrics` returns 404 | public metrics route removed | configure separate admin listener and local authenticated collector | see observability contract |
| unit fails `ProtectSystem` writes | state dir mis-ownership | `journalctl -u …` shows EROFS/EACCES | `chown -R rds:rds /var/lib/rds` |
| relay floods under open access | `--allow` unset on public IP | connection count in logs/metrics | set `--allow` to estate EndpointIds |

### Observability quick reference

```sh
# Create a NEW private scrape token; no endpoint identity or secret stdout.
rds admin-token --file /private/rds-admin-token
# Set paired --admin-addr/--admin-token-file daemon flags, then use Vector
# with the private token file; avoid placing secrets in curl arguments.
# With RDS_LOG_FORMAT=json in the unit, substitute the exact run and session.
journalctl -u rds-agent -o cat | jq -R --arg run '<run-id>' --argjson session 7 \
  'fromjson? | select(.schema_version == 1 and .run_id == $run and .session_id == $session)'
```

## Process diagnostics and observability

Use [the observability contract](observability.md) for shared stderr logging,
the schema-1 JSON export, Vector/OpenObserve development qualification and
alert definitions. Set `RDS_LOG_FORMAT=json` in the private service environment
before collection. Full `text` output is local debugging material and must not
be treated as a redacted export. No production collector/backend is deployed
by adding these repository examples; private service capture/rotation,
ingestion credentials, retention and independent liveness remain deployment
work. The public directory metrics route is removed, including for loopback
requests. Migrate scrapers to the opt-in authenticated admin listener and
keep its token out of public proxy configurations.
