# RDS remediation execution

Started: 2026-09-24. Plan: [remediation-plan.md](remediation-plan.md).
Audit baseline: `87e7aeabaad861b0d3c63f6641c91539be19a3e0`.
Audit/plan snapshot: `6772d4a`. Historical findings stay in the dated audit;
this file records implementation progress rather than rewriting that evidence.

## Current state

All waves remain open. W1.1–W1.4 and W1.6–W1.8 passed the local Linux check
matrix; other tasks remain planned unless listed below. No deployment or owned-backend
promotion has occurred. Native macOS checks still require their platform lane.

| Task | State | Evidence / remaining scope |
|---|---|---|
| W0.1 | Partial | R01/R10 are agent regressions; R02 is now covered by transactional record/delete regressions; R03/R04 are journal regressions, with failures observed before fixing. R05 is covered by planted-link and directory-substitution tests. R06 failed before the name proof fix; R07 is covered by server expiry checks. R08 has failing-before actual-client Drain/drop regressions and passing framing/grace checks. R09 has failing-before direct/relay candidate regressions and passing family/cancellation checks. Desktop body cancellation still needs its owning fixes/tests. |
| W1.1 | Implemented; Linux checks passed | Denylist replacement retains its value without observers; atomic modification preserves concurrent revocations. Subscribe-before-check and initial watchdog snapshot check remove missed-update windows. Durable feed freshness remains W1.4. |
| W1.2 | Implemented; Linux checks passed | One authorization state owns admission, replay reservation and watchdog. ACK failure/cancellation closes the connection and releases the grant. Service admission checks live validity/revocation. Connection future teardown runs RAII cleanup. |
| W1.3 | Implemented; Linux checks passed | Client trust anchor, per-name domain-separated signatures, exact name/record binding, current validity and volatile anti-rollback. Native directory HTTPS/DNS added; durable revision linkage stays W1.4 and native macOS verification remains open. |
| W1.4 | Implemented; Linux checks passed | Shared durable policy acceptance, positive epochs/revisions, domain-separated signatures, bounded revocation leases, restart/boot rules, dual-signed rotation, atomic feed ownership and live closure. Name trust persists across CLI processes. Native macOS/power-loss qualification and external GDS rollback anchoring remain open. |
| W1.5 | Partial | Transactional bounded disk store, tombstones, generation anchor, publisher revisions, exact retry, durable announce, leased expiry, retained floors, bounded collection, configured enrollment, fair write admission, strict HTTP framing and explicit format-2 offline migration are implemented. A 4096-identity Linux capacity/churn/reopen run passed. Legacy cutover, release-load/startup profiling, physical failure and native macOS qualification remain open; see validation below. |
| W1.6 | Implemented; Linux checks passed | Reused bytes are verified and stored before `have`; edits, insertions, deletions, repeated chunks and destination removal/restart are tested. |
| W1.7 | Implemented; Linux checks passed | Exclusive staging and RAII cleanup preserve ordinary/link siblings and colliding names; failed assembly retains the old file. Current staging uses reserved names inside locked private state, allowing deterministic recovery. |
| W1.8 | Implemented; Linux checks passed | Directory-relative no-follow journal/destination I/O and a held source file replace path-check-then-open. Link planting and substitutions after open are tested. Native macOS verification remains pending. |
| W1.9 | Partial | Pull path and Done-root binding, exact frame decoding, canonical Need, batch bounds, requested/unique chunks, verified completion, actual wire-byte accounting and absolute session budgets are implemented. Explicit transfer IDs/negotiation, stronger cancellation barriers and native macOS qualification remain open. |
| W1.10 | Partial; Linux transaction checks passed | Root and destination-parent locks cover overlapping roots and filesystem aliases. Reserved private staging, both-parent sync and bounded known-name recovery are implemented. 23 transaction/cleanup boundaries cover process exit and two returned-error classes. Physical power loss, native macOS, large-file campaign and inactive/legacy journal collection remain open. |
| W2.1 | Partial; endpoint settings checked on Linux | Shared version-1 endpoint JSON, explicit file/flag precedence, typed backend/relay validation, preflight before identity creation, owned-relay CLI/agent selection and canonical TCP targets shared with client and agent policy are implemented. Role-level service/authority settings and timeout policy remain open. |
| W2.2 | Partial; exact ALPN selection | Immutable per-protocol TLS offers prevent silent fallback and concurrent request interference. Capability/limit/version negotiation and session/transfer routing IDs remain open. |
| W2.5 | Partial; transport and agent task ownership | Owned policy tasks terminate; uni routing is bounded and acyclic. Agent and client forwarding groups own cancellation, normal joins and positive admission budgets. Global RSS/FD bounds, per-service fairness, relay queues and disk cancellation remain open. |
| W2.6 | Partial; client preludes bounded | One request deadline covers stream credit, writes, replies and Ping echo; canceled Authz closes its connection. Initial agent handshake/shutdown budgets exist. Global timeout classes, retry jitter, startup/relay and desktop/media deadlines remain open. |
| W3.1 | Partial; initial candidate race | Eight supported direct candidates plus attached relay share a deadline and one authenticated winner. Dual-stack routing and cancellation are checked. Independent relay bootstrap, remote scope/interface discovery and real topology qualification remain open. |
| W3.3 | Partial; relay control and grace | Shared exact bounded codec, actual Drain/PeerGone receipt, usable grace traffic and stale-slot ownership are checked. Warm secondary relay and measured active-session migration remain open. |
| W3.6 | Partial; validated selection and bounded credit retry | Extra paths become eligible on Established; weak policy ownership includes bounded backoff for temporary connection-ID/path-credit exhaustion and candidate-address snapshots. Path-event resynchronization, complete metrics and transport-failure isolation remain open. |

## Authorization change

`rds-agent::authz` owns Pending → Authorizing → Granted → Closed. Services
remain pending while an authorization response is being written. The watcher
is installed before that I/O; a 15-second response deadline bounds it.
Duplicate Authz cannot replace a pending or granted lease. Failed verification,
response write, interrupted commit and canceled admission close the connection.
Closing the connection cannot be undone by a late admission task.

The watchdog checks the current denylist immediately, then observes updates
and wall-clock expiry. Each service also checks policy directly so correctness
does not depend only on watchdog scheduling. Replay reservations and watchdogs
are released through owned drop guards, including cancellation of the
connection service future.

Regression evidence before implementation:

- `revocations_survive_without_watchers`: failed; initial revoked ID was lost.
- `concurrent_revocations_are_not_lost`: failed; fewer than 16 concurrent IDs survived.
- `failed_authz_reply_closes_connection_and_releases_grant`: failed; stopped
  reply retained the connection beyond the test's bounded observation window.

Additional coverage exercises simultaneous admission ownership, a snapshot
already present before watchdog startup, admission cancellation, immediate
service-scope revocation/expiry and reservation cleanup.

Local validation on 2026-09-24: `cargo fmt --check`; workspace clippy with
default features, `rds-desktop/x11`, and all features (all with `-D warnings`);
`cargo test --workspace`; `cargo test -p rds-agent --all-features` (5 unit and
15 integration tests). All passed. Native macOS execution is still pending.
`cargo-deny` is not installed locally. No wave checkpoint is claimed: these
changes do not close W1 or replace historical benchmark evidence.

The signed revocation feed still needs durable anti-rollback/freshness/offline
policy (W1.4); this patch does not close all of audit A02. Audience binding and
renewable leases remain W2.3. Long-lived service task ownership remains W2.5.

## Sync correctness and filesystem change

Baseline `cargo test -p rds-sync --test journal` failed four regressions:
partial reuse was lost on reopening, repeated reused chunks could not assemble,
and both the ordinary `.rds-part` sibling and its link variants were deleted.
The new journal materializes reused content, including size-changing deltas,
then assembles only verified parts. `fetched` counts network chunks, not reuse.

`confined::Directory` holds directory handles and uses safe `rustix` bindings
for relative no-follow opens, rename and unlink. The private state directory
has mode 0700, including journals created by the earlier implementation.
Staging files use exclusive creation and random 128-bit names; collision
handling never removes someone else's entry. All state reads are length-bounded
and refuse special files, symlinks and multiply linked part files. Cleanup
does not recursively walk arbitrary journal entries.
The journal namespace is reserved regardless of ASCII case; a second check
compares opened directory identities to refuse filesystem case/Unicode aliases
of `.rds-sync` before descending into a peer-requested path.

The configured root's ancestors and the local OS identity are trusted. A held
directory is an inode capability, including after rename; this does not promise
an absolute pathname boundary against a privileged/local actor relocating that
inode. A remote peer cannot select arbitrary roots or enter `.rds-sync`.
Journal and destination directory handles stay pinned throughout I/O; pull
chunk reads use the same opened file as the manifest, with positioned reads
shared across senders.

Receives within one root are serialized by one persistent lock inode. This
intentionally also prevents alias races on case/Unicode-insensitive filesystems
and avoids an unbounded collection of per-filename locks. Separate roots remain
independent. More granular parallel receives require a proven alias model.
Existing parts remain readable after upgrading, but old and new receive
processes must not share a root concurrently: old binaries do not take the
new lock. New staging files have mode 0600; file metadata preservation is W8.5.
The receiver watches control-stream cancellation while collecting chunks;
sender task ownership uses `JoinSet` so cancellation aborts its async children.
Blocking disk jobs can finish their current operation and drain their bounded
queue; fully interruptible scans and absolute budgets remain W1.9/W2.5.

File and parent sync occur before reporting commit. A parent-sync error after
rename reports uncertainty and keeps recovery state; the caller receives no
false `Done`. The process-crash test targets committed parts and lock recovery;
it does not simulate loss of OS caches or certify macOS power-loss durability.
Unknown orphan staging entries are preserved for future owned-state GC (W8).

Dependency rationale: `rustix` supplies thin safe OS calls; `rand` supplies
staging entropy. Both versions were already in `Cargo.lock`. No helper process,
native code block or new dependency version is introduced by the sync runtime.

## Measurement fixture correction

An intermediate workspace run failed the existing 20-second desktop soak:
frame age p95 1319 ms, p99 1657 ms, 835 received frames. Running the **same
compiled test alone**, without changing its thresholds, passed at p95 32 ms,
p99 63 ms and 1110 frames. This indicates sensitivity to the execution context;
it does not establish a unique root cause or certify production latency.

Inspection also found that the supposed clean in-process desktop lane used
default endpoints with public discovery enabled. That fixture now explicitly
binds loopback and disables discovery, so its direct-path claim is enforced.
Impairment remains on the separately configured controlled socket lane. The
150/250 ms p95/p99 budgets are unchanged. The final check matrix passed after this fixture correction and the journal
namespace-alias check: format; workspace clippy in default, X11 and all-feature
configurations; and `cargo test --workspace` (135 tests in 36 targets). The
sync crate contributes 5 unit, 13 journal and 14 end-to-end tests. Native macOS
and power-loss qualification remain open; no entire wave is closed.

## Name identity verification

Regression `unsigned_directory_name_cannot_select_an_identity` failed before
implementation: the client accepted the endpoint key in an unsigned JSON
answer. The directory now serves a `SignedNameBinding`, created by the registry
issuer for each name. The client requires an independently configured verifying
key, checks the signature's domain/version/name/lifetime, and the resolver then
binds the endpoint record to the verified key. No whole inventory or issuer
secret is returned to a lookup client.

The directory verifies all per-name proofs agree with the uploaded registry,
refuses snapshots without them, and stops serving names at expiry. The old
wire response is intentionally unsupported; the issuer must re-sign snapshots
and clients must provision `--registry-key`. Migration is documented in
`deployment.md`. Maximum binding lifetime is 24 hours with no future timestamp
allowance; bounds are 256 names per snapshot, 256 KiB serialized snapshot,
256-byte binding payload and 1024 remembered names per client. Cache overflow
refuses new names instead of discarding freshness evidence.

The timestamp cache is shared across client clones and rejects older or
conflicting same-issued-at responses. It is not durable and cannot discover a
withheld newer revocation or name removal. Revision/epoch persistence,
authority rotation and outage policy are W1.4.
Pinned ticket/key paths remain independent of name resolution.

Local validation: format, default/X11/all-feature workspace clippy and
`cargo test --workspace` passed (141 tests in 38 targets). Six new name-trust
tests exercise unsigned answers, wrong names/issuers/records, signature-domain
confusion, malformed/oversized proofs, redirects, future/expired/excessive
lifetimes, rollback/equivocation and server expiry. Native macOS remains open.

## Directory HTTPS and DNS

`Client::from_endpoint` accepts a validated HTTP(S) origin or legacy plaintext
socket address. TLS checks public WebPKI roots and hostname/IP SAN; explicit
private CA bundles replace the roots. URL credentials, paths, queries,
fragments, malformed origins and CA configuration on plaintext are refused.
Requests send the correct Host authority. There is no TLS-verification bypass,
HTTP downgrade or redirect following. Signed identity checks still run over TLS.

One deadline covers DNS, bounded staggered TCP attempts (16 maximum), handshake
and response. Dropping that future aborts its pending dial tasks; native OS
resolver work can complete later without extending the caller's deadline.
The TLS-only server listener reserves capacity before spawning and bounds the
entire handshake/request. Its owned JoinSet bounds active/completed handles and
aborts async request children on service drop. Blocking stores remain W1.5;
this is not a claim of complete W2.5
task ownership throughout the agent.

Six TLS tests passed locally: DNS lookup and signed record/name roundtrip;
missing/wrong name authority despite valid TLS; untrusted CA, wrong hostname
and expired certificate rejection; strict origin/PEM configuration and Host
header; stalled handshake timeout without plaintext retry; capacity recovery
and pending request teardown. The full Linux matrix passed: format;
default/X11/all-feature workspace clippy with warnings denied; and
`cargo test --workspace` (147 tests in 39 targets). Native macOS, edge proxy
compatibility and certificate renewal automation remain open.
All three binaries (`rds`, `rds-agent`, `rds-server`) also built and executed
`--help` successfully with their new directory TLS/CA options present.

Dependency rationale: rustls/tokio-rustls provide standard TLS, rustls-pki-types
parses PEM, webpki-roots supplies trust data, and url validates/normalizes DNS/IP
origins. rcgen generates synthetic test certificates only. All versions already
existed in Cargo.lock. No helper binary is added. The selected existing ring
crypto provider contains native code/assembly; this is not a pure-Rust crypto
implementation claim. TLS and protocol policy stay in RDS Rust code.

## Next sequence

While validating W1.4, the workspace run exposed a measurement race in
`bounded_queue_newest_wins`: draining a live queue returned 65 headers over
time even though the instantaneous capacity is 64. Receiver depth now has the
same atomic diagnostic access as sender depth, and the test checks occupancy
before and during a bounded batch. Frame order, freshness and the 64-entry
limit remain asserted; no capacity or latency budget was relaxed. The focused
regression passed after this W0.1 fixture correction. Full matrix results are
recorded with the policy change that triggered the run.

Continue W1.5 directory transactions and W1.9 wire
binding/accounting. Each change retains
its own failing-before/passing-after evidence. No general CI or long soak is
made a blanket barrier to independent development; actual invariant failures
are repaired and platform evidence is recorded separately.

## Durable policy acceptance and managed revocation

W1.4 replaces second-resolution timestamp ordering with explicit authority
epochs and revisions. Name proofs bind to the signed registry digest; the CLI
persists one global revision floor across names/processes. Policy snapshots and
lease metadata commit together through protected, exclusively owned staging
before publication. Failed writes poison the store and close managed access;
corruption, missing initialized state or unknown bootstrap keys never select an
empty fallback. A lower-revision bootstrap cannot replace the directory's
committed state. Unchanged cache hits do not rewrite/sync the marker file.

The managed agent observes revoked IDs and freshness in one value. Startup can
use a verified same-boot cache only until its original absolute lease ends;
replies and restarts cannot rearm that lease. OS reboot needs a newer revision.
Admission, admission commit, new service requests and the live watchdog all
check policy. A feed has one owner; shutdown/fatal persistence error prevents
late publication, and obsolete callbacks cannot overwrite a successor.
Authority rotation requires signatures by both the current and next key and
advances the epoch by exactly one.

Five real-QUIC managed-feed cases passed, covering fresh/missing policy,
revocation, outage, cached restart with older network replies, feed drop and
failed disk commit. Nine policy-state cases cover ordering, boot/clock changes,
rotation, linked/corrupt/missing state and bounded wire inputs. Fault and abrupt
child-exit tests cover five persistence boundaries. Directory/client integration
tests cover actual restart and cross-process-style cache reuse. The worker
budget test confirms a timed-out HTTP request cannot free a still-running disk
job's permit. Its initial test assertion was corrected to use the client's
typed `RateLimited` error for HTTP 429; no production limit changed.

Linux validation: `cargo fmt --check`; default, X11 and all-feature workspace
Clippy with warnings denied; `cargo test --workspace` (**170 tests, 43 targets**).
The owned transport/relay feature suite also passed (**52 tests, 17 targets**).
The five managed-feed cases were additionally rerun with their endpoints
explicitly selecting noq, and all passed. `rds`, `rds-agent` and `rds-server`
built and executed `--help` with the new state/epoch/rotation flags.
The first workspace failure and the separate desktop fixture correction are
recorded above. `cargo-deny` is not installed. Native macOS, physical suspend,
power loss and real estate deployment were not run. No wave is closed and no
performance qualification is claimed. See the [policy receipt](reports/rds-policy-20260924.md)
and [migration/operational contract](policy-state.md).

## Record transaction foundation

W1.5 now keeps delete tombstones in both stores, serializes mutations and stores
record/tombstone/catalog updates in an embedded Rust transaction. The file
store's separately synced generation anchor refuses database-only rollback of
acknowledged history. Corrupt/missing initialized files and legacy directories
are refused; unexpected I/O closes the instance until recovery. Eight new
integration tests and six unit tests cover replay, concurrency, confinement,
bounded storage, partial writes, sync faults and process exits. No runtime
subprocess or database service is added. Migration is deliberately not inferred
from old files; deployment remains pending the versioned publisher work.

Formatting and all three Clippy lanes passed. The default workspace run failed
the existing parallel desktop soak latency gate (p95 176 ms/p99 1447 ms); a
single isolated diagnostic rerun passed at 10/16 ms. The complete sequential
test run passed **184 tests, 44 targets**. This does not erase the default-run
failure or close W0/W6 performance evidence. No thresholds changed. See the
[record transaction receipt](reports/rds-records-20260924.md) for exact scope.
That storage patch left signed revisions and durable publisher allocation for
the following change, then expiry/quotas, enrollment fairness and HTTP framing.

## Versioned endpoint publication

The next W1.5 change replaces timestamp ordering with one positive revision
sequence for record updates and deletion. New signature domains bind version,
identity, revision and bounded validity. Verification precedes variable-field
decoding; exact signed retries are idempotent, while equal-revision conflicting
content and older mutations are refused. Both stores enforce current lifetime
on writes and reads; resolver checks remain independent of the server.

`RecordIssuer` persists the counter and pending signed bytes before publication.
The CLI owns durable state, while fixtures explicitly select volatile issuers.
Same-second address changes receive different revisions. Retries preserve signed
bytes until actual renewal/change; restart resumes the pending operation. Fatal
history/disk failures and permanent protocol refusals reach the agent supervisor
instead of silently stopping the announce loop. Existing connections close on
that fatal CLI path. A lost successful HTTP reply is exercised through a real
directory and proxy, with an identical second request accepted successfully.

Ten revision/issuer cases and three announce lifecycle cases cover retry,
conflicts, delete ordering, expiry, wire bounds, restart, missing history and
permanent rejection. Publisher fault tests cover five write/rename/sync phases,
including abrupt child exits. Old fixtures that advanced `issued_at` into the
future were updated to use revisions. The expiry test now checks both a 410
from the real store and independent client rejection of an expired signed
record returned by a hostile HTTP 200 response.

Record validation and the owned transport share a typed `rds-relay://` locator
parser, preserving relay identity and IPv4/IPv6 sockets. The real owned relay
test now goes through announce, directory storage and resolution before forcing
the handshake, datagrams and stream exchange onto the relay. This caught a
compatibility gap in an HTTP-only validation rule; the previous IPv6 bracket
parse failure is also corrected. No IPv6 network qualification is implied.

The first workspace run exposed a state-lock lifetime issue: a descriptor alias
can retain flock after its owner drops. A deterministic reproducer failed;
explicit guard release now passes across atomic state, database and sync root
locks. See the [separate lock receipt](reports/rds-locks-20260924.md), committed
as `8a18064`. This correction does not add sleep/retry to hide a failed invariant.
The final default `cargo test --workspace` run passed **204 tests across
46 targets**, including the parallel desktop smoke test and crash/reopen cases.
Formatting and default, X11 and all-feature workspace Clippy also passed with
warnings denied. This does not qualify sustained production latency or erase
the preceding failed-run evidence.

`cargo test -p rds-net -p rds-agent -p rds-relay --all-features` passed
**58 tests across 18 targets**, including the real owned-relay feature (not just
the noq endpoint feature). The agent binary built and executed `--help` with
`--record-state`. See the [publisher receipt](reports/rds-publisher-20260924.md).
Native macOS, physical failures, migration and real estate deployment remain
unqualified. This receipt precedes the expiry-retention change below.

## Record expiry and retention

W1.5 now persists each record/delete acceptance lease, using the same boot and
suspend-inclusive clock adapter as policy state. Exact retries cannot rearm it.
Expiry observed by a read commits retirement and a clock floor before returning;
expired addresses/signatures are reclaimed while revision/digest/kind history
remains. OS reboot requires a newer signed revision. Backward wall time refuses
operations until it catches up. Whole-state rollback still needs a GDS anchor.

Both stores share expiry/order decisions and retain at most 4096 identities;
memory deployments can choose a lower capacity. Collection keeps those identity
slots. A higher revision for an existing identity remains possible at identity
saturation. One owned maintenance worker visits at most 64 rows per pass,
separately from request-worker capacity, with retirement/failure metrics.
Concurrent renewal and collection serialize through the store transaction.

An HTTP 410 triggers a durable local successor; losing its reply retries the
same new bytes. HTTP 409 remains fatal. An already acknowledged publisher checks
the server again on its normal renewal, so immediate recovery after server reboot
is not claimed. Native platform, physical-failure and latency qualification
remain open. The database is format 3; deployment migration is still on hold.

The Linux matrix passed: formatting; default/X11/all-feature workspace Clippy
with warnings denied; **221 workspace tests across 47 targets**; and **59 tests
across 18 targets** for the network/agent/relay all-feature lane. Targeted checks
also passed: 38 discovery unit tests, two service-collection tests and four
real-HTTP publisher lifecycle tests. See the
[expiry receipt](reports/rds-expiry-20260924.md). No wave gate is closed.

This receipt precedes the admission change below.

## Publisher enrollment and write fairness

Default directory configuration now denies record access. Production explicitly
lists publishers with `--directory-allow`, independent of relay/agent permissions
and registry names. The static list is bounded to 4096 distinct nonweak keys;
removal hides records while preserving floors. GDS live reconciliation remains W4.

The before-fix regressions failed: unconfigured publication succeeded, and one
writer's refused requests spent the shared counter and blocked another device's
renewal. Both now pass. Stores verify and compare before invoking quota admission
under the same compare/commit owner. Exact retries, stale operations and bad
signatures do not spend the owner's quota; concurrent identical copies charge
once. Callback refusal does not change the record or poison storage.

Known identities have one protected mutation in each fixed 60-second window.
New admissions and extra writes have separate shared budgets, with per-identity
limits checked first. Each policy role has its own budget after signature and
revision validation. TTL/3 renewal with TTL >= 180 fits the reserved cadence;
faster renewals need burst capacity. The guarantee concerns write quotas, not
isolation from arbitrary network, CPU or disk saturation.

Validation and limits are recorded in the
[admission receipt](reports/rds-admission-20260924.md). The full Linux matrix
passed: formatting; default/X11/all-feature Clippy with warnings denied;
**234 workspace tests across 48 targets**; **59 all-feature network/agent/relay
tests across 18 targets**; and server build/`--help` with `--directory-allow`.
No wave completion is claimed. Next: strict HTTP framing, explicit
migration/file-capacity qualification, then W1.9 wire/accounting.

## Unambiguous directory HTTP framing

Seven regressions failed against admission commit `e46125f`, including a real
signed PUT that modified storage despite conflicting Content-Length fields.
Both directions now share strict header validation and reject ambiguous lengths,
transfer encoding and malformed fields/start lines. Exact head/body bounds and
outgoing validation apply before a body is consumed or bytes are emitted.
Buffered head reads retain prefetched body data; the connection always closes
after one exchange. Parsed HEAD responses omit bodies, including on overload.

The expanded framing target passes eleven cases, including the real client,
maximum binary bodies fragmented through a tiny stream, truncated messages,
bodyless statuses and pipelined-request closure. The
[HTTP receipt](reports/rds-http-20260924.md) preserves the before/after evidence
and the [private API profile](record-state.md#directory-http-profile) describes
compatibility limits. No helper program or dependency was added. Particular
proxy/tunnel routes and native macOS execution remain unqualified.

The Linux matrix passed: formatting; default/X11/all-feature Clippy with warnings
denied; **245 workspace tests across 49 targets**; and **59 all-feature network/
agent/relay tests across 18 targets**. The first extra feature run exposed a
one-second expiry-fixture race; the receipt records its correction and the
successful default and all-feature reruns, without changing production expiry
semantics. Next: file-capacity qualification and explicit migration, then W1.9.
All waves remain open.

## Full directory capacity measurement

The Rust `rds-bench directory-capacity` scenario uses shared production bounds,
fresh synthetic state and 32 IPv6 addresses/eight maximum raw relay origins per
large record. It passed **16,384 signed mutations and four full reopens** at
4096 retained identities. The extra identity was refused without charging an
admission callback; existing records continued to renew and deleted identities
reactivated at higher revisions. Maximum sampled database length was **35.004
MiB** under the unchanged 256 MiB cap. See the
[capacity receipt and raw artifacts](reports/rds-capacity-20260924.md).

This is one bounded Linux run in a dev build with optimized cryptographic
dependencies, not release throughput or physical-failure qualification. Complete
catalog validation during reopen took **1.54–15.98 seconds** across four samples;
startup/recovery profiling remains open alongside sustained renewal load. The
first unoptimized attempt was deliberately stopped after filling the catalog
to replace its undersized overall harness deadline; it is retained as partial
evidence, not counted as a pass.

At that checkpoint the next implementation step was the
[offline migration checklist](record-migration-plan.md): preserve format-2 signed
revision floors without inventing new leases; treat timestamp/legacy formats as
a separate authenticated cutover. That plan alone did not provide a migration
command or deployment approval. The implementation update follows below.

Final Linux checks passed: formatting; default/X11/all-feature workspace Clippy
with warnings denied; **245 workspace tests across 49 targets**; both harness
build profiles and the CLI state-preservation guards. No dependency or external
runtime helper was added. All waves remain open.

## Explicit format-2 offline migration

`rds-server migrate-v2` now verifies a read-only source copy and imports all signed
revisions/deletions as retired format-3 floors. It retains the original bytes,
rejects existing or ambiguous destinations and publishes the complete new sibling
only after catalog validation, a durable receipt and exclusive rename. Imported
addresses require a newer signed publication. Intent and receipt files remain in
protected sibling audit state; there is no automatic live cutover, retry or cleanup.
See [operation and remaining qualification](record-migration-plan.md) and the
[2026-09-25 receipt](reports/rds-migration-20260925.md).

Linux validation passed returned-error and abrupt-exit cases at 12 migration
checkpoints, malformed/history/ownership cases and real HTTP 410 → durable
successor → unread reply → issuer restart/exact retry. The separately invoked
4096-identity capacity migration preserved every floor and source byte. Import
took 67.658 seconds in an unoptimized test build; it is an offline conversion
measurement, not connection latency. Final formatting, three workspace Clippy
lanes, **256 workspace tests** and **59 all-feature network/agent/relay tests**
passed. No dependencies or external runtime helpers were added.

W1.5 remains open for timestamp/per-key legacy cutover, external GDS anchoring,
release load/startup, physical-failure and native macOS qualification. Next local
implementation work is W1.9: bind sync requests and acknowledgments to their
intended file and enforce unique chunk accounting and bounded protocol progress.

## Sync request, completion and progress integrity

W1.9 now binds a pull Offer to its requested normalized path before receive state
is opened, and both sender roles verify the Done root. The shared frame decoder
requires an exact postcard payload. Need bitmaps, manifest parts and chunk sets
have enforced dimensions and padding; empty streams/batches and duplicate or
unrequested indices fail. Headers agree with the manifest before allocation,
and the journal must verify every requested index before assembly and Done.
The receive route is registered before Need. Wire-byte statistics count actual
requested payload, so identical reuse reports zero chunks and zero bytes.

Every role has a one-hour default absolute session budget, with explicit library
overrides and five-minute I/O stall bounds. Progress never extends that deadline.
The blocking writer signals every exit through an owned one-shot channel, waking
collection immediately on verification/storage failure or panic, including when
the peer becomes silent. No detached network wait can hide that worker exit.
Read [the exact contract](sync-protocol.md) and
[regression evidence](reports/rds-sync-protocol-20260925.md).

Four transport regressions and the shared-frame regression failed before their
fixes. An additional corrupt-body/silent-peer case exposed the missing worker
notification during validation; it now fails promptly while retaining prior
destination contents and releasing journal ownership. The ten protocol scenarios
cover both transports for path/root binding and owned transport for malformed
input, timeout, reuse and cleanup cases.

Final Linux validation after the worker-exit correction passed formatting,
default/X11/all-feature workspace Clippy with warnings denied, **267 workspace
tests across 50 targets**, and **59 all-feature network/agent/relay tests**. Existing
impaired transfers, resume and concurrent desktop/sync behavior remain covered.
The separate 4096-row migration qualification is unchanged. No dependency or
runtime helper program was added; `cargo-deny` remains unavailable locally.

W1.9 remains partial for explicit transfer IDs/negotiation and native macOS
qualification. Blocking syscalls and a started complete file replacement can
outlive async cancellation; stronger publication barriers remain W2.5/W8. Next
local work is W1.10's remaining journal commit/failure/collection evidence, then
W2's unified session configuration, negotiation and lifecycle ownership. No
existing wave is closed by these changes.

## Journal commit recovery and overlapping receive roots

W1.10 now holds a common destination-parent lock in addition to the configured
root lock. A new regression failed before this fix: roots `root` and
`root/nested` could concurrently receive the same destination. Nested private
namespace access also failed its new regression; `.rds-sync` is now reserved at
every depth, including handle-level alias checks.

Assembly lives under its parent's locked private state and syncs both directory
parents after rename. Metadata and part transactions use reserved private
temporary names. Recovery removes only known regular single-link temporary
files, verifies committed parts and preserves unknown data. Cleanup after
durable publication is synced and best effort without changing a committed
success into failure. Existing journal parts remain compatible.

The [recovery contract](sync-journal.md) and
[receipt](reports/rds-sync-journal-20260925.md) distinguish 23 process-exit cases,
46 injected-error cases and 12 temporary-object cases from physical-failure
qualification. Final formatting, three Clippy lanes, **273 workspace tests** and
**59 all-feature network/agent/relay tests** passed. One historical test allowing
nested private paths was updated to enforce the corrected namespace contract.

W1.10 stays partial for physical power loss, native macOS, actual nested mounts,
the large-file kill campaign and W8's inactive/legacy journal collection/quotas.
Async disk cancellation and concurrent destination edits remain separate work.
No new dependency, unsafe block, external runtime helper or deployment was added.
Next local implementation is W2.1 endpoint configuration validation and explicit
backend/relay selection, followed by negotiation and lifecycle ownership. No
wave is closed by this local increment.

## Versioned endpoint configuration

CLI and agent now share a bounded JSON endpoint schema with explicit defaults,
file/flag precedence and mutually exclusive relay modes. Unknown fields, unused
backend-specific relay settings and invalid dimensions fail before endpoint
identity creation. Iroh refuses extra bind addresses; noq refuses iroh relay
URLs instead of ignoring them. Its key-pinned owned relay is configurable through
both binaries. An outer relay socket now uses an independent ephemeral port,
preserving a fixed primary bind. Endpoint secrets and policy authorities remain
separately provisioned. See [configuration](endpoint-configuration.md) and the
[receipt](reports/rds-endpoint-config-20260925.md).

Two new baseline tests failed for ignored settings. A fixed-port owned relay
fixture failed during integration and now passes against a real local relay.
The strict-schema tests caught an ignored-field serde corner case. The original
socket-mux test also caught an overly strict duplicate rule: repeated port 0
requests now correctly allocate independent sockets, while fixed duplicates fail.

Final formatting and three Clippy lanes passed, along with **285 workspace tests**,
**72 all-feature network/agent/CLI/relay tests**, four feature-isolated schema tests
and five isolated binary tests. An initial disk-full build was recovered by
clearing only this workspace's generated incremental cache and limiting compiler
parallelism; it is not runtime durability evidence. Existing dependency versions
are unchanged; `rustix` and `thiserror` become direct network dependencies and
`serde_json` moves from test to runtime use. No runtime helper program was added.

W2.1 remains partial for unified role/service/authority configuration and timeout
policy. The next local correction is common SSH/TCP destination parsing and
preflight, followed by negotiated sessions, scopes and structured lifecycle work.
Native macOS, real reachability/failover and deployed integration remain open.

## Canonical SSH/TCP destination preflight

W2.1 now shares `rds-core::TcpTarget` between both command-line frontends,
the client library and agent wire handling. Canonical IP/hostname representation
is used by both policy matching and actual TCP dialing. IPv6 flags use brackets;
invalid syntax, oversized names, non-unicast literal addresses and zero ports
fail before network operations. Actual binary tests verify invalid flags leave
the identity file absent. Development `allow_any_tcp` still validates targets.

Two baseline argument regressions and two policy regressions failed before the
fix. A real IPv6 TCP service is reached through both QUIC backends while an
off-policy address stays denied; malformed raw requests are rejected and do not
prevent a subsequent valid request. See the
[contract](endpoint-configuration.md#tcp-service-destinations) and
[receipt](reports/rds-tcp-target-20260925.md). No dependency, wire version or runtime
helper changed. Syntax normalization does not replace DNS address pinning or
SSH host-key/authentication policy. Role configuration, timeout classes and
negotiated session ownership remain open. The next local correction is the
owned path driver's terminal lifecycle (audit T05 / W2.5).

The all-feature matrix exposed a W1.2 ordering race: a successful Authz ACK can
reach the peer before the authorization task resumes to commit, so an immediate
service was incorrectly rejected as pending. A deterministic real-QUIC test
reproduced it. Services now wait for an in-progress admission with a deadline,
subscribing before inspecting state, then recheck the committed grant and policy.
Failed commit and closure wake the waiters without granting access. Tests cover
commit, abort and revocation; the original managed-policy integration fixture
remains unchanged. Requests arriving before authorization starts still fail.

Final formatting and three Clippy lanes passed, as did **296 workspace tests**,
**81 all-feature network/agent/CLI/relay tests** and **7 isolated binary tests**.
The initial full-feature failure and its deterministic reproduction are retained
in private evidence; only the corrected final matrix supports these totals.
No deployment or remediation wave closure occurred.

## Owned connection-driver teardown

Audit T05 / W2.5 now uses a weak QUIC closure notification to terminate the
path-policy loop, including when closed handles remain alive or the last I/O
handle drops. Endpoint-owned tracking seals admission before closing connections
and waits for policy-task cleanup. Completed tasks are removed immediately.
Pending QNT history and closed weak path handles are pruned.

Both lifecycle regressions failed before the correction. Five focused tests
also cover stream-only ownership, 32 connection cycles returning to zero tasks,
and concurrent endpoint close with eight retained connection pairs. Final
formatting, three Clippy lanes, **301 workspace tests** and **86 all-feature
network/agent/CLI/relay tests** passed. See the
[receipt](reports/rds-driver-lifecycle-20260925.md). Existing locked `tokio-util`
becomes an optional direct dependency for task tracking; no package version,
wire protocol, unsafe code or runtime helper program was added.

W2.5 remains partial for uni-stream routing, agent/service task groups, global
and per-session budgets, relay queues and disk cancellation. Validated path
selection and larger churn/load qualification remain W3.6. R08 concerns relay
Drain framing and stays open, as does R09 candidate fallback. The next local
lifecycle work is the uni-stream router's ownership and pending-task bounds.
No wave or deployed release is closed by this increment.

## Uni-stream router ownership and limits

Two real-QUIC regressions failed on iroh and owned noq: dropping the facade and
inbox left the connection retained by its own router task. The private router
now uses weak owner references; live inboxes can still own I/O independently
of facade handles. Its task group caps tag/queue handoff work at 64 workers.
Closure cancels and joins them before registered producers are cleared; each
inbox keeps at most 128 buffered streams for explicit draining.

Tests cover last-owner teardown, facade clones, surviving inboxes, 80 partial
tags, ready routing behind a stalled tag, reclaim and a full 128-slot inbox
with 64 pending handoffs. Existing fixtures now retain the peer handle and
actually send a partial tag instead of only opening a local stream. Final
formatting, three Clippy lanes, **307 workspace tests**, **92 all-feature
network/agent/CLI/relay tests** and **7 feature-isolated routing tests** passed.
See [contract](uni-routing.md) and [receipt](reports/rds-uni-routing-20260925.md).
No dependency, unsafe code, wire version or runtime helper changed.

W2.5 remains partial for agent/service ownership, admission and other resource
budgets, relay pumps and disk cancellation. Kind-based routing still needs
session IDs, negotiated limits and per-service fairness; local task bounds are
not RSS/FD or latency-percentile acceptance. The next local lifecycle work is
owned agent connection/service tasks and bounded admission. No wave is closed.

## Agent service ownership and admission

Two before-fix regressions showed runner cancellation left child sessions alive
on both transports. The agent now owns connection/service groups and inline
metrics sampling. Normal closure joins its authorization watchdog and service
workers. Admission slots cover pending handshakes and live connections, while
per-connection stream budgets apply backpressure. The positive CLI limits
validate before identity creation. See [contract](agent-lifecycle.md) and
[receipt](reports/rds-agent-lifecycle-20260925.md).

Real TCP forwarding, runner/direct-serve cancellation, saturated partial hellos,
refusal/readmission, watchdog cleanup and invalid binary limits passed. Final
formatting, three Clippy lanes, **314 workspace tests** and **100 all-feature
network/agent/CLI/relay tests** passed. No dependency or wire version changed.

W2.5 and W2.6 remain partial: cancellation destructors request nested aborts;
only the normal path joins all these children. Global resource bounds, client
forwarding, relay pumps, media/disk cancellation, service fairness and complete
timeout/retry policy remain open. Next: complete client request deadlines and
owned bounded local forwarding. No remediation wave or deployment is closed.

## Complete client preludes and owned TCP forwarding

Two real-QUIC regressions reproduced unbounded stream-credit/write waits before
the old ACK timeout. Requests now have one 15-second prelude budget, and failed
or canceled streams reset/stop. Authz cancellation closes its connection;
successful one-shot responses end at FIN. TCP/Sync bodies retain their own
service policy. Local forwarding uses a positive configurable worker limit and
owned cleanup, with normal joins and cancellation-triggered socket closure.

Final formatting, three Clippy lanes, **323 workspace tests**, **109 all-feature
network/agent/CLI/relay tests** and **13 isolated CLI tests** passed. See
[contract](client-lifecycle.md) and [receipt](reports/rds-client-lifecycle-20260925.md).
Existing iroh is a new test-only direct dependency; no package version or runtime
helper changed. W2.5/W2.6 remain partial for global budgets, startup, relay/media
ownership and full timeout/retry classes. Next: shared bounded owned-relay
control framing, actual Drain/PeerGone receipt and preserved grace traffic.
No remediation wave or deployed release is closed.

## Cancellation of queued sync stores

The relay-control full matrix exposed a G6 immediate-retry refusal while prior
disk work still held its exclusive receive lock. Two deterministic regressions
confirmed a canceled sink continued storing queued chunks. Its guard now aborts
unstarted blocking work and stops running workers between stores, including
when finish is canceled. Normal finish still drains and verifies every chunk.

Formatting, sync Clippy, **3 focused unit tests** and **14 sync e2e tests** passed.
See [contract](sync-journal.md#receive-cancellation) and
[receipt](reports/rds-sync-cancel-20260925.md). G6's final phase now tests bounded
byte-identical convergence after transient refusal; a fixed 30 ms wait does not
guarantee remote cleanup. Executing syscalls and commits remain protected by
their journal lock. Open/scan and assembly cancellation barriers stay open.
No dependency, wire type or wave status changed. The final relay-control matrix
will revalidate this correction together with its pending network changes.

## Shared relay control framing and grace

Before-fix tests reproduced the missing Drain notice and socket-drop attachment
leak. One bounded exact codec now covers both ends and every control variant.
Notices use owned bounded groups and lock/write deadlines; partial failure
closes its stream's connection. Control reading shares the server connection
future. Socket destruction cancels pumps, while explicit close joins them.

Actual Drain receipt preserves grace-period datagrams. Replacement ownership
protects flow history and subsequent PeerGone/Pong framing. The first full run
exposed the independently corrected queued-sync-store issue above; its failure
is retained in evidence. The final rerun passed formatting, three Clippy lanes,
**329 workspace tests**, **118 all-feature network/agent/CLI/relay tests**
and **3 isolated codec tests**. See [contract](relay-control.md) and
[receipt](reports/rds-relay-control-20260925.md). Only existing noq was added as a
test dependency; no new package or runtime helper was introduced.

R08 notice receipt is corrected; W3.3 remains partial for warm failover and
SSH/video/sync interruption acceptance. Global relay admission/queues and
server task ownership remain W2.5. R09 initial candidate racing is next; native
macOS and real network qualification stay open. No remediation wave is closed.

## Initial candidate race and consistent socket families

Two before-fix failures confirmed that the first silent address blocked a healthy
second direct candidate or attached relay. The owned dialer now races bounded
authenticated attempts under one deadline and owns loser cancellation. IPv6
testing additionally exposed first-socket family inference and fatal unroutable
QNT probes; the mux now maintains mapped/native address consistency, while
unsupported candidates are filtered before the cap and policy path opens.

Focused validation passed 14 tests. Final formatting, three Clippy lanes,
**337 workspace tests**, **128 all-feature network/agent/CLI/relay tests**
and **22 isolated owned-network tests** passed. A 20/20 loopback handshake
smoke run is included, without WAN/parity claims. See [contract](candidate-dialing.md)
and [receipt](reports/rds-candidate-dial-20260925.md). No dependency or runtime
helper changed.

W3.1/W3.6 remain partial for relay bootstrap, scoped interface discovery, validated
path selection and transport-failure isolation. Requested ALPN narrowing is the
next bounded protocol correction. No remediation wave or deployment is closed.

## Exact requested transport protocol

Three before-fix real-QUIC failures confirmed that the owned backend could ignore
the requested ALPN. Immutable exact-protocol configurations now serve each dial
and its candidate attempts, while preserving the endpoint-wide TLS cache bound.
Repeated alternating and concurrent protocol requests, refusal of unsupported
protocols and an immediately invalid first address are tested.

Focused validation passed 16 tests, including existing backend interoperability.
Final formatting, three Clippy lanes, **341 workspace tests**, **132
all-feature network/agent/CLI/relay tests** and **26 isolated owned-network
tests** passed. See [contract](protocol-negotiation.md) and
[receipt](reports/rds-alpn-selection-20260925.md). No dependency or wire version
changed. W2.2 remains partial for capability/limit/version negotiation and
session/transfer IDs. Validated path selection is next. No wave is closed.

## Validated application path eligibility

The before-fix silent-path test observed premature Available status. The policy
now seeds only the authenticated handshake, subscribes before explicit path/QNT
work, and admits extra paths to selection on Established. A real validated
secondary carries a datagram after logical primary close. A deterministic slow
primary remains preferred over a silent candidate with a lower default RTT.
The QUIC engine's existing prohibition on unvalidated payload is unchanged.

Four focused real/simulated cases passed. Final formatting, three Clippy lanes,
**344 workspace tests**, **135 all-feature network/agent/CLI/relay tests**
and **25 isolated owned-network tests** passed. See [contract](path-selection.md)
and [receipt](reports/rds-path-selection-20260925.md). No dependency or wire
version changed.

The next bounded correction is owned retry when extra-path connection IDs have
not yet arrived. Event loss, complete metrics, physical failover, native macOS
and service recovery remain open. No remediation wave is closed.

## Bounded retry for delayed path credits

A failing-before simulation proved that the automatic secondary attempt was
lost while a later manual attempt on the same listener validated. The policy
now owns bounded credit retry, candidate-address reconciliation and source-aware
withdrawal without retaining strong I/O handles across awaits. Five queue unit
cases and two delayed-link regressions cover backoff, bounds, replacement data
and cancellation. The focused run passed 32 tests.

Final formatting, three Clippy lanes, **351 workspace tests**, **142
all-feature network/agent/CLI/relay tests** and **32 isolated owned-network
tests** passed. See [contract](path-selection.md) and
[receipt](reports/rds-path-credit-20260925.md). No dependency or wire version
changed. Initial family fairness is next; lost path events, metrics, transport
failure isolation and physical/native-platform qualification remain open.
No remediation wave is closed.
