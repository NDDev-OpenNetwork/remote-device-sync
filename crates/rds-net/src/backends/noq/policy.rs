//! Path policy: candidate ordering, path opening, and path selection.
//!
//! The first cut is deliberately conservative: deduplicate, cap the
//! candidate set at the multipath path limit, open the first candidate as
//! the primary path, then offer the rest via `open_path_ensure`. Relay
//! candidates are ignored until the relay transport lands (WS2).
//!
//! `connection_driver` is the per-connection control loop: it consumes
//! QNT address advertisements (peer-learned candidates become paths) and
//! path events, and keeps exactly one lowest-RTT path `Available` while
//! the rest become `Backup`. noq's packet scheduler follows path
//! statuses; it does not migrate on its own — the selection policy is
//! ours, mirroring iroh's biased-RTT selector with stickiness.
