//! Path policy: candidate ordering, path opening, and path selection.
//!
//! The first cut is deliberately conservative: deduplicate, cap the
//! direct candidate set at the multipath path limit, race initial handshakes
//! in `dial`, then offer additional paths via `open_path_ensure`. An attached
//! relay contributes one additional initial candidate through the socket mux.
//!
//! `connection_driver` is the per-connection control loop: it consumes
//! QNT address advertisements (peer-learned candidates become paths) and
//! path events, and prefers one lowest-RTT validated path among the observed
//! set. Other application-opened paths stay `Backup`. noq's scheduler follows path
//! statuses; it does not migrate on its own — the selection policy is
//! ours, mirroring iroh's biased-RTT selector with stickiness.
