# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- Core transport foundation: six-crate workspace (`rds-core`,
  `rds-transport`, `rds-relay`, `rds-agent`, `rds-cli`, `rds-desktop`) on
  iroh 1.2 / QUIC with Ed25519 endpoint identity, hole-punched direct
  paths and self-hosted relay fallback.
- `rds` CLI: `id`, `ticket`, `ping`, `info`, `ssh`, `forward`, `desktop`.
- `rds-agent`: peer `EndpointId` allowlist, scoped TCP forwarding
  (default: local sshd only), desktop session service behind `desktop`.
- `rds-relay`: embedded iroh-relay with endpoint allowlist.
- `rds-desktop`: capturer/encoder/decoder/input traits, MoQ-style
  per-frame uni streams with stale-frame drop, X11 capture + XTEST input
  + OpenH264 codec behind the `x11` feature.
- `docs/architecture.md`: transport/desktop research and decisions.
- Initial Rust skeleton: library crate and `remote-device-sync` CLI stub.
